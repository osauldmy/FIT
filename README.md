# About

Repository for 2 (of total 3) homeworks (multithreading and memory manager à la malloc)
I implemented for BI-OSY (Operating Systems) class at FIT CTU in semester B192 (2019/2020).

3rd homework (à la RAID5 or RAID6 read/write) is missing in this repo as I didn't implement it.

Tasks provided in this repo are in Czech language.

# TODO

Try to get the tasks in English or at least try to translate them.
