"Memory manager" homework in pure C with only pointers arithmetic.

The homework task is in Czech language and is located in task.png (screenshot from progtest.fit.cvut.cz)
and in task.txt as well (without aux images, just copied plain text from progtest).

task.png pictures not only the task but referential implementation and my implementation (memory usage and timings stats, points gained).

My implementation passed all required, but didn't pass nonrequired and bonus tests.
