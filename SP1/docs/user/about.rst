What is Apixy?
================
Apixy is a web application with a configurable REST API acting as a proxy for various data sources. This API aggregates data from various kinds of data sources, such as HTTP API, SQL database or MongoDB collections. You can create your independent projects consisting of different sources and define a merging strategy (2 methods currently supported) which will be used when the data is fetched and aggregated. You can also set a caching timeout on the fetched data.
