# About

Homework in multithreading (either C++11 threading API or pthread.h). I used C++11 threading API.

The homework task is in Czech language and is located in task.png (screenshot from progtest.fit.cvut.cz) and in task.txt as well (without aux images, just copied plain text from progtest).

task.png pictures not only the task but referential implementation and my implementation (memory usage and timings stats, points gained).

My implementation passed all required and nonrequired tests, but didn't pass bonus tests.

My code is located in *solution.cpp* (except `main()`). The rest of the code **is not mine** and was provided as helping code in order to do the homework.

Helping code with Makefile, static lib and tests was provided like sample.tgz archive, so student only should have to unarchive it, program
the CSentinelHacker class in solution.cpp and then submit solution.cpp to progtest.
